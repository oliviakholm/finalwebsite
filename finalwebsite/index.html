        <p class="v1">I'm a marketing, design, and communications student in Minnesota. I am currently attending college at Minnesota State University, Mankato. I have a job that I really enjoy at Cambria as a Gallery Coordinator. I love cooking, baking, going out with my friends, and spending time with my family.  </p>

        <p class="v1">I am working towards a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Marketing and minoring in graphic design as well as communications. I also received an Associate of Arts Degree while I was in high school from Rainy River Community College.
        Once I graduate, I hope to find a job in social media or advertising. I really enjoy that both options will allow me to use the knowledge I gained from my education as well as my creativity.</p>

        <p class="v1">2020 was a wild year, to say the least. As a person of color this past year was especially difficult. I want to provide some resources to help support the black community. Here are <a  class="blm" href="https://shoppeblack.us/2020/05/black-owned-businesses-in-minnesota-that-need-your-support/">Black Owned Businesses in Minnesota</a> that need your support as well as Netflix's <a class="blm" href="https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/81299227?so=su">Black Lives Matter playlist</a> to help educate on the injustices people of color face.
